Add-A-Layer
===========

-I started by sketching out my layout ideas.
-Once finalized I started by creating the broad html outline and linking to the sections that I would later poulate with photos.
-Once html was finished I soon relized that I wanted each image to wrap around itself so (with Dexters help) used the float function in css to properly order my sections as well as centering the <h2> tags on each.
-Once functionality was established in linking each photo I then added font and color (although very little).
